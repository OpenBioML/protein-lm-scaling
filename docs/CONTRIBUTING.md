# Contributing

If you are looking for ways to contribute, please check out our [task board](https://github.com/orgs/OpenBioML/projects/8) or our [open issues](https://github.com/OpenBioML/protein-lm-scaling/issues)!


## Issue Assignment

If you see an interesting issue, please feel free to comment or ask questions! Issues are generally resolved by code changes to our repository via a [pull request](#creating-a-pull-request). If you would like to be the one responsible for the code changes corresponding to an issue, and if nobody else has already been assigned to the issue, you can be assigned the issue by asking the issue creator or one of the moderators of repository, or by self-assigning the issue by commenting with `/take`.

## Unit testing

When working on a particular issue, please also include relevant unit tests together with the code. Please see the following for example tests: [example 1](https://github.com/OpenBioML/protein-lm-scaling/blob/main/protein_lm/tests/test_tokenizer.py) [example 2](https://github.com/OpenBioML/protein-lm-scaling/blob/main/protein_lm/tests/test_encoding.py). 

## Creating a Pull Request

In order to contribute code to this repository, you must make a pull request (PR).

First, make sure you have a GitHub account and have git installed locally. Then, to make your first pull request,

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) our [repository](https://github.com/OpenBioML/protein-lm-scaling) by clicking on the [fork](https://github.com/OpenBioML/protein-lm-scaling/fork) button on the repository's main page. 
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork.
3. [Create a new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
4. Make your code contributions on this new branch.
5. [Create a PR from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to our repository.

(For subsequent pull requests, skip steps 1 and 2 and start directly from step 3.)

Once your pull request has been discussed, potentially updated, and approved, it will be merged by one of the project leads. If you have reached this step, congratulations and thank you for contributing!
